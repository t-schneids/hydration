# hydration
Our product is a smart hydration tracking system that will come in the form of a web application that is responsive and mobile friendly. This product is designed for health-conscious users, and athletes. The system will allow users to set personalized hydration goals or follow statistically proven recommendations based on factors such as age, weight, activity level, and climate (where they live). The web app provides real-time insights, refill tracking to measure plastic waste reduction, and progress goals to help encourage long-term, healthy, hydration habits. Using timely notifications and data analysis, our goal is to help users stay consistently hydrated while promoting sustainability.
